                'Sugar' Ray Robinson (born Walker Smith Jr.; May 3, 1921 – April 12, 1989) was an American professional
                boxer who competed from 1940 to 1965. Robinson's performances in the welterweight and middleweight
                divisions prompted sportswriters to create "pound for pound" rankings, where they compared fighters
                regardless of weight. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. He is
                widely regarded as the greatest boxer of all time, and in 2002, Robinson was ranked number one on The
                Ring magazine's list of "80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years".

                Robinson was 85–0 as an amateur with 69 of those victories coming by way of knockout, 40 in the first
                round. He turned professional in 1940 at the age of 19 and by 1951 had a professional record of 128–1–2
                with 84 knockouts. From 1943 to 1951 Robinson went on a 91-fight unbeaten streak, the third-longest in
                professional boxing history. Robinson held the world welterweight title from 1946 to 1951, and won
                the world middleweight title in the latter year. He retired in 1952, only to come back two-and-a-half
                years later and regain the middleweight title in 1955. He then became the first boxer in history to win
                a divisional world championship five times (a feat he accomplished by defeating Carmen Basilio in 1958
                to regain the middleweight championship). Robinson was named "fighter of the year" twice: first for his
                performances in 1942, then nine years and over 90 fights later, for his efforts

            <p>
                "Smokin Joe", was an American professional boxer who competed from 1965 to 1981. He reigned as the
                undisputed heavyweight champion from 1970 to 1973, and as an amateur won a gold medal at the 1964 Summer
                Olympics. Frazier was known for his strength, durability, formidable punching power, and relentless
                pressure fighting style. He was also the first boxer to beat Muhammad Ali.

                Frazier emerged as the top contender in the late 1960s, defeating opponents that included Jerry Quarry,
                Oscar Bonavena, Buster Mathis, Eddie Machen, Doug Jones, George Chuvalo, and Jimmy Ellis en route to
                becoming undisputed heavyweight champion in 1970, and followed up by defeating Muhammad Ali by unanimous
                decision in the highly anticipated Fight of the Century in 1971. Two years later, Frazier lost his title
                when he was defeated by George Foreman. He fought on, beating Joe Bugner, losing a rematch to Ali and
                then beating Quarry and Ellis again.

                Frazier's last world title challenge came in 1975, but he was beaten by Ali in their brutal rubber
                match, the Thrilla in Manila. He retired in 1976 following a second loss to Foreman. He made a comeback
                in 1981, fighting just once before retiring for good, finishing his career with a record of 32 wins, 4
                losses and 1 draw. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Frazier among the ten greatest
                heavyweights of all time. The Ring magazine named him Fighter of the Year in 1967, 1970 and 1971,
                while the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1969, 1971 and
                1975. In 1999, The Ring magazine ranked him the eighth greatest heavyweight. BoxRec ranks him as the
                18th greatest heavyweight of all time. He is an inductee of both the International Boxing Hall of
                Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.

                Frazier's style was often compared to that of Henry Armstrong and occasionally Rocky Marciano, dependent
                on bobbing, weaving and relentless pressure to wear down his opponents. His best-known punch was a
                powerful left hook, which accounted for most of his knockouts. In his career, he lost to only two
                fighters, both former Olympic and world heavyweight champions: twice to Muhammad Ali, and twice to
                George Foreman.

                Roy Levesta Jones Jr. (born January 16, 1969) is an American former professional boxer, boxing
                commentator, boxing trainer, rapper, and actor who holds dual American and Russian citizenship. He
                competed in boxing from 1989 to 2018, and held multiple world championships in four weight classes,
                including titles at middleweight, super middleweight, light heavyweight and heavyweight, and is the
                only boxer in history to start his professional career at junior middleweight and go on to win a
                heavyweight title. As an amateur he represented the United States at the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning
                a silver medal in the junior middleweight division after one of the most controversial decisions in
                boxing
                history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jones is considered by many to be one of the best boxers of all time, pound for pound, and left his
                mark in the sport's history when he won the WBA heavyweight title in 2003, becoming the first former
                middleweight champion to win a heavyweight title in 106 years. Prior to that, in 1999, he became the
                undisputed light heavyweight champion by unifying the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles. During his prime,
                Jones was known for possessing exceptional hand speed, athleticism, movement and reflexes.
                As of February 2018, Jones holds the record for the most wins in unified light heavyweight title
                bouts in boxing history, at twelve. The Ring magazine named Jones the Fighter of the Year in 1994, and
                the
                World Boxing Hall of Fame named him the Fighter of the Year for 2003. He is also a three-time winner
                of the Best Boxer ESPY Award (1996, 2000, and 2003). The Boxing Writers Association of America named
                him as the Fighter of the Decade for the 1990s.
